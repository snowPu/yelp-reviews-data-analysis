       "'Complimentary:\\nSalad appetizer - very good\\nNoodle appetizer - excellent\\n\\nVolcano roll - amazing\\nSpicy medallions - ok, a bit filling\\nSashimi - very good quality\\n\\nBlack sesame ice cream - good Lots of variety, always get lobster and chicken and duck congee which are both delicious. Came here for summerlicious. \\n\\nEscargots - in tomato sauce, was ok, I prefer it with a creamy or cheesy dressing.\\n\\nBeef carpaccio - delicately balanced flavours, delicious.\\n\\nSeafood pasta - had a good rose sauce, not too salty and not too bland, just right.\\n\\nProfiteroles were very good.\\n\\nOverall ok-good food, some dishes winning out over others. The butter chicken was good. Also had side dish of cauliflower and garlic naan, both were also good. Satisfies a butter chicken craving. Had the Buttermilk calamari which was delicious, very unique flavour with red pepper purée sauce. \\nAlso had the duck confit pizza, with sweet gingered pear and Gorgonzola cheese, perfect combination of flavours. My favourite was the prosciutto and arugula pizza, also very flavourful. \\n\\nI had the espresso cinnamon gelato which was delicious with very intense flavour. Also on special pistachio gelato which was very creamy. \\n\\nWould go here again and again. Had the eel bento box and black dragon roll. When you dine in they serve you lots of appetizers, salads etc. which are really good. Everything is top notch. I\\'ve gone here lots of times. Dumplings are good, satisfying and SUPER cheap. Not as high quality as nearby restaurant xiao long bao. Not as much soup. Their kalbi beef never fails and their sashimi is great overall. I especially like their little bowls of ramen and wontons, those are addictive, I think because of the sesame oil they use to season them.\\n\\nBeen here 3 times now and always leave satisfied. Sketchy looking, but food was good. Your typical Chinese fare. Had lobster and Peking duck, both were pretty good. Every pastry we had was delicious, especially the spicy cornbread pastry and croissant. If I lived in Montreal, would go here again and again to try all their baked goods. Calamari and fish tacos are good. Butter chicken disappointing. Had the beef burrito with everything. Pretty good, not the best that I\\'ve had, but better than fat bastard burrito. Best Mexican food in town!\\n\\nMy favourites were the Baja fish tacos, tinga tacos and churros which are made fresh!\\n\\nThe shrimp ceviche tostadas were good. Guacamole satisfied my craving. \\n\\nYummy jurrito pineapple pop. These were so-so. The juicy dumplings were not as juicy as other soup dumplings I\\'ve had. Great variety!\\n\\nFavourites:\\nUnagi (grilled eel, without rice!)\\nCoconut shrimp\\nChicken cheese skewers\\nShrimp sugarcane\\nSoup dumplings\\nEscargot\\nShrimp in blanket\\nBacon wrapped asparagus and mushroom\\nBeef short ribs\\nThousand island shrimp\\nChicken lettuce wrap\\nCalamari\\n\\nPina colada\\nDessert comes in a trio (vanilla pudding with strawberry sauce, creme brulee, refreshing orange jello with orange pieces)\\n\\nOk:\\nShrimp chow mein\\nSeaweed salad\\nHak how\\nSiu mai\\nCha siu bow\\nSashimis (salmon, tuna, whitefish, butter)\\n\\nI did not like:\\nAny of the skewers, dry\\nSpicy salmon\\nCalifornia salad (not like the picture)\\nMango salad (raw)\\nCrispy beef\\nSalmon tataki Terrific food, delicious most of the time. Wasn\\'t a fan of their boar pie. Food is ok, tortillas are great, but I had it a year ago and don\\'t think they have it on their menu anymore. The wings are dry. Appetizers were good, but the pasta dishes were salty. Had the wild boar pizza which was very good. Similar flavour profile to the duck confit pizza at pizzeria libretto. The fish tacos were also very good, fresh and nice smokey flavour to them. Their ice coffee was just right. Not too sweet. Will go back again. The quinoa onion rings are cruncy deliciousness.\\n\\nHad the beach bowl with soba noodles which had a lot of good ingredients, but the flavour was a bit on the plain side. I had to try this and the smoked meat sandwiches were ok, I think they are an acquired taste. Too salty for my liking but I can understand how some would love this place. Most delicious and succulent tandoori chicken you can get in the East end. The rice has as great light flavour to it as well. Comes with salad and bread. Ordered the tuna tostadas which were amazing, great balance of flavours. \\n\\nEverything else was too salty (the royal burger, the pasta alfredo, calamari). Their breakfast foods were ok, but was not a fan of the steak and kidney pie. I\\'ll probably try their other pies though someday. Fast service. Was not busy at 6:00pm on Friday. Had the brisket Mac n cheese which was delicious but small for $9. Also tried the calamari which was good but nothing special, the chipotle sauce was good. The fish taco was very unique, different from most, very fresh tasting. The apple maple pork belly was also a nice appetiser, again quite unique flavours that blended well. \\n\\nMy favourite was the brisket Mac n cheese. Overall a bit on the pricey side, but good for special nights out. Great deal for lunch buffet. Not spicy.\\nTandoori chicken - juicy and succulent, the best dish here\\nPaneer saag - very good\\nButter chicken - very good\\nLentils - very good\\nVeggie Pakoras - very good\\nNaan bread - very good, baked fresh\\nRice - very good\\nVanilla ice cream - very good\\nEverything else was ok.\\nMango lassi - weird taste, too sour.\\nMango beer \"Cheetah\" was ok. The chicken here was good but nothing out of the ordinary. After hearing so many rave reviews I set my hopes up high. I probably won\\'t come here again. Had chicken and beef, which was tasty. Good service. Didn\\'t have to wait too long to get a table. Never had soup dumplings before, they were very juicy and burst with flavour. Onion pancakes were so-so. Beef brisket noodle soup was also very tasty. The jerk chicken was ok, it didn\\'t stand out compared to other jerk chicken dishes I\\'ve had. The ox-tail was amazing, but this is the first time I\\'ve had it.\\n\\nCurry goat roti - had high expectations, but it disappointed. Strong gamey flavour, I\\'ve had much better curry goat dishes. Melt in your mouth goodness. Waited in line for 15 min at 9:30 am on Wednesday. Good time to go! Best xiao long bao in Toronto! I think it\\'s better than ding Tai Fung. Beef pancake was so so. But will be coming back here for the soup dumplings! Got some to go too! Very addictive. Everything here is delicious. Had the quinoa risotto, wonderful complex flavours. Been here two times for work outings and would go many more times. Very delicious and very filling. Friendly service. The lamb was delicious.'"
